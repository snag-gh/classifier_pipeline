A score for this class indicates that the extracted DNA is likely not suitable for classification by methylation profiling. The cases constituting this class are mostly low grade tumors (gangliogliomas or pilocytic astrocytomas) but also some high grade tumors. The cases share low tumor cell content and frequently show strong reactive changes (high proportion of reactive glial cell and frequently pronounced lymphocytic infiltration). Depending on the content of tumor cell, copy number alterations may be masked."	23	"15 (3-27)"	1.3	NA	"Ganglioglioma with low tumor content (8; 34.8%)"	"Pilocytic astrocytoma   with low tumor content (6; 26.1%)"	"supra (10; 58.8%), PF (7; 41.2%), spinal (1; 5.9%)"	"pending"	"DC"	15	3	27	15	"Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype  (3: 13%)"	44	"Control "	"GLIOMA_NORM_HI"	"Methylierungsklasse Kontrollgewebe, reaktives Hirngewebe"
